# Stock Analysis

## Overview
The program under analysis was written to analyze the daily volume and return on a vast amount of stock data. The original program seemed to be running slowly. The code has been refactored. The purpose of this anastock-analysislysis is to determine whether or not the refactored code is running and a significantly reduced rate to make computing more efficient.

## Results
  Initial run times for the original code was about 1 second for each year of stock analyzed (*Figure 1 and Figure 2)*. 2017 at ~0.96 seconds and 2018 at ~1.14 seconds.
