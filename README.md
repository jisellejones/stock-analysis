# Stock Analysis

## Overview
The program under analysis was written to analyze the daily volume and return on a vast amount of stock data from 2017 and 2018. The original program seemed to be running slowly. The code was refactored to reduce run time. The purpose of this anastock-analysislysis is to determine whether or not the refactored code is running and a significantly reduced rate to make computing more efficient.

## Results
  For the original code, run times were around 0.83 seconds for each year of stock analyzed *(Figure 1 and Figure 2)*.

Once refactored, the run time decreased by about 0.69 seconds *(Figure 3 and Figure 4)*
